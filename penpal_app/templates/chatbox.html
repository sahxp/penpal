                    Hello, Let me introduce myself first. My name is Vaibhav and I'm 28 years old. I live in New
                    York City and work as a software engineer. I love my job because it's challenging and allows
                    me to be creative. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, listening to music and playing
                    basketball. What about you? What do you do for a living? What are your hobbies?

                    I'm interested in learning more about your country and culture. Could you tell me more about
                    the local customs and traditions? What are some of your favorite local dishes? I'm sure the
                    food in your country is delicious!

                    I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Take care and stay safe.

                    It was great to receive your letter! I'm glad to have a new friend from the United States.
                    My name is Maria and I'm 25 years old. I live in Madrid, Spain and work as a nurse. It's a
                    very rewarding job, as I get to help people every day. In my free time, I enjoy hiking,
                    painting and learning new languages.

                    Spain is known for its delicious food, especially paella and tortilla de patatas. We also
                    have many traditions, such as La Tomatina, a festival where people throw tomatoes at each
                    other. Have you heard of it?

                    I'm also interested in learning more about your country. What are some of the famous
                    landmarks in the United States? What are some of your favorite foods? I'd love to know more
                    about your culture and way of life.

                    Thank you for writing to me, Vaibhav  . I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon.
